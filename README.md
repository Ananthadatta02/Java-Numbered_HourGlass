# Java-Numbered_HourGlass
This Java program generates a numbered hourglass pattern based on user input. It first prints the upper half by decreasing the width and centering numbers in a palindromic sequence. The lower half mirrors the top. The code uses nested loops for spaces and number alignment, creating a symmetric hourglass shape.
